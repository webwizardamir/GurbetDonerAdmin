# Bugs and Fixes Log

This document tracks bugs encountered during development and their solutions for future reference.

## Phase 1: Customers Module

### Bug 1: Missing Helper Functions in Database

**Error:**
```
ERROR: function is_admin_user() does not exist (SQLSTATE 42883)
```

**Cause:**
The Phase 1 migration (`00005_phase1_customers.sql`) referenced helper functions (`is_admin_user()`, `is_owner()`) that were supposed to be created in Phase 0, but weren't applied to the database.

**Solution:**
Created a fix migration (`00006_fix_customers_rls.sql`) that:
1. Creates the missing helper functions with `CREATE OR REPLACE`
2. Sets up RLS policies for the customers table

**Prevention:**
- Always verify that dependent migrations have been applied before creating new ones
- Use `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` for helper functions to make migrations idempotent

### Bug 2: Column Does Not Exist - billing_city

**Error:**
```
column customers.billing_city does not exist
```

**Cause:**
Migration file was created but not pushed to the Supabase database.

**Solution:**
Run `npx supabase db push` to apply pending migrations.

**Prevention:**
- After creating migration files, always run `npx supabase db push`
- Check `npx supabase db push --dry-run` to see pending migrations

### Bug 3: NOT NULL Constraint Violation on Import

**Error:**
```
null value in column "contact_person" of relation "customers" violates not-null constraint
```

**Cause:**
The original schema (`00001_initial_schema.sql`) defined `contact_name TEXT NOT NULL`. When renamed to `contact_person`, the NOT NULL constraint remained. The CSV import didn't provide values for this column.

**Solution:**
Created migration (`00008_fix_contact_person_nullable.sql`):
```sql
ALTER TABLE customers ALTER COLUMN contact_person DROP NOT NULL;
```

**Prevention:**
- When designing schemas, consider which fields are truly required vs optional
- For B2B systems, contact_person should be optional (some companies may not have a specific contact)
- Review column constraints when planning import features

## Common Supabase Migration Issues

### Issue: Migration Partially Applied

**Symptom:**
Migration fails mid-way, some changes applied, others not.

**Solution:**
1. Create a new fix migration with the remaining changes
2. Modify the original migration to remove the parts that were already applied
3. Push again with `npx supabase db push`

### Issue: RLS Blocking Operations

**Symptom:**
Operations fail silently or return empty results.

**Solution:**
1. Check RLS policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'table_name'`
2. Verify user has correct role in profiles table
3. Test with `is_admin_user()` function directly

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check pending migrations
npx supabase db push --dry-run

# Apply migrations
npx supabase db push

# Check Supabase CLI version
npx supabase --version

# View migration history (in Supabase Dashboard)
# Go to Database > Migrations
```

## Schema Design Lessons Learned

1. **Optional Fields**: For B2B systems, most contact/address fields should be nullable
2. **Soft Delete**: Decided against `is_active` for customers - simpler to just delete
3. **Helper Functions**: Create reusable permission-check functions (`is_owner()`, `is_admin_user()`) early
4. **RLS Policies**: Always create RLS policies when creating tables with sensitive data
